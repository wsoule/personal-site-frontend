## Description

Join us for an engaging and hands-on workshop where you'll learn to create a modern note-taking application using SwiftUI and SwiftData. This workshop is designed for developers with a basic understanding of Swift and iOS development who want to dive into the powerful features of SwiftUI and the latest SwiftData framework.

What you'll learn:

- Introduction to SwiftUI and SwiftData: Get acquainted with SwiftUI's declarative syntax and how it simplifies UI development.
- Understand the basics of SwiftData, Apple's new framework for data management and persistence.




Building the User Interface:
- Design the main interface for the note-taking app, including a list view to display notes and a detail view for editing.
- Learn how to use SwiftUI components like List, NavigationView, and Form to build a responsive and intuitive UI.

Implementing Core Features:
- Add functionality to create, read, update, and delete notes.
- Explore SwiftUIâ€™s data binding to keep your UI in sync with your data model.

Data Management with SwiftData:
- Define your data model using SwiftData.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with SwiftData to manage notes.

Testing and Debugging:
- Learn best practices for testing your SwiftUI views and SwiftData interactions. We'll get a bonus introduction to the new Swift Testing API!

Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming.
- Familiarity with Xcode and iOS development concepts.
- Prior experience with UIKit or SwiftUI is helpful but not required.

What You'll Need:
- A Mac computer with the latest version of Xcode installed.
- An Apple Developer account (optional but recommended for testing on a physical device).
