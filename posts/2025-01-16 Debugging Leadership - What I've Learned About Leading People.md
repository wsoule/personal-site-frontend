# Description
So you've decided to take the leap and you're going to be managing people. Congratulations! But... now what?

In this session I'll talk about my journey to leading people, while dealing with the complexities of handling human emotions, team dynamics, and unforeseen obstacles.

We'll delve into the insights I gained on the way: how to nurture trust and open communication, strike a balance between empathy and responsibility, and most importantly how to cultivate a leadership approach that truly reflects who you are. From the errors I've made to the victories I've savored, this session focuses on the unfiltered aspects of leadership.

Whether you're aiming for a leadership position or simply seeking an outlook on what it means to lead others, come along as I explore what I wish I had known before stepping into a leadership role. And how I "debugged" my way through the process.
