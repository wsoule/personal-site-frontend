# Description
Prepare to embark on a thrilling journey into the depths of TypeScript with us!


In this workshop, weâ€™re diving headfirst into the lesser-traversed territories of TypeScript. We'll explore the beginning of the realms of advanced type manipulations, navigating the landscape of Generics, Mapped Types, Conditional Types, and more.

If you're eager to kick your TypeScript skills into overdrive and venture beyond the confines of basic type-checking, this workshop is for you.
