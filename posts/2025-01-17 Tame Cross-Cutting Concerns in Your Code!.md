Description

Cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and validation can quickly clutter your codebase if not handled correctly. This session is designed for developers and software architects looking to streamline their code by applying design patterns.

In this code-heavy session, we'll start with an application that resembles many real world web APIs and has to deal with common tasks like logging, exception handling, validation, telemetry, and authentication in addition to the actual work performed by each endpoint.

You'll learn how to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns without polluting your core business logic, making your code cleaner, more maintainable, and adaptable to change. Through practical examples, youâ€™ll learn multiple patterns and see them applied to real code, resulting in a more robust and maintainable solution.

Sample code will use C# but concepts and patterns will apply to other languages and platforms.
# Notes

## What is a Concern in Software?

- A piece of logic that serves a particular purpose.
- Often changes independently from other parts of the system.

## Common Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Validation**
- **Error Handling**
- **Logging**
- **Data Access**
- **Business Logic**
- **UI Logic**
- **Authorization**
- **Caching**

## Related Design Pattern
