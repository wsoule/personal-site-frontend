# Notes
>[!NOTE]
> Description
> 
> There you are, sipping an Old Fashioned and refactoring your codebase, when a wild-eyed manager knocks on your door and begs your help to implement a RAG app demanded by The Board. When they call, will you be ready to design a solution with GenAI?
> 
> We weren't. We tuned into podcasts, watched youtube videos, ran tutorials, tracked AI GrantÂ recipients, read research papers, joined discord servers, debated pipedreams with strangers, and built toy projects until we felt qualified to write GenAI services.
> 
> All of that theory and technical practice gave us the coveted "how", but not the "where", "why", or "when" of applying GenAI. To get that good good intuition, we had to write domain-specific business problems and then design solutions that leverage GenAI. The practice worked! It brought confidence to sales calls in domains that we have never worked in and, unexpectedly, made us better at collaborating with each other.
> 
> Join us for an interactive solution-design session! We took GenAI use-cases that we built ourselves or saw in the real-world and adapted them into a set of katas.
>
> We'll work in three stages:
>
> 1. Preparation: Form a team and pick a kata
> 2. Design Phase: Collaborate a solution with your team
> 3. Peer Review Phase: Discuss the tradeoffs of your approach with the group at large
