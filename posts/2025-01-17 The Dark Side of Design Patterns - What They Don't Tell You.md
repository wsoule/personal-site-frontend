Description

Design patterns are potent tools in software development that solve recurring problems and are essential for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust systems. However, not all design patterns are created equal. Some well-respected patterns may inadvertently lead to increased complexity, decreased maintainability, and hinder productivity.

Join us as we explore specific design patterns that can cause more work than they are worth. Through real-world scenarios, we will uncover how these patterns can lead to unintended consequences such as convoluted code, performance bottlenecks, and intricate debugging sessions.
# Notes

## Significance of Design Patterns

- **Benefits:**
    - Code Reusability
    - Scalability & Maintainability
    - Common Vocabulary
    - Best Practices
    - Abstraction & Flexibility
    - Ease of Maintenance
    - Learning & Onboarding
    - Documentation

## Main Types of Design Patterns

- **Creation**
- **Structural**
- **Behavioral**
- **Architectural**

## Applying Patterns Judiciously

- Not all patterns are equally suitable for every context.
- Appropriateness depends on the nature of the software being developed.
- Evaluate trade-offs carefully before adopting a pattern.

## Problematic Patterns

- **Singleton**
- **Observer**
- **Factory**

## Anti-Patterns

- God Object
- Spaghetti Code
- Copy-Paste Programming
- Magic Numbers
- Hard Coding
- Lava Flow

## Singleton Pattern

### Characteristics

- Single instance
- Global Access
- Lazy Initialization
- Private Constructor
- Static Instance Method/Property

### Pros

- Centralized Logging
- Global Access to Logger
- Lazy Initialization
- Instance Reusability
- Simple Initialization

### Cons

- Global State
- Tight Coupling
- Testing Challenges
- Hidden Dependencies
- Inflexible Initialization
- Thread Safety Issues:
    - Race Conditions
    - Double-Checked Locking
- Potential for Misuse

### Alternatives

- Dependency Injection
- Factory Method Pattern
- Service Locator Pattern
- Inversion of Control Containers
- Prototype Pattern
- Thread-Safe Singleton Initialization
- Enum Singleton
- Immutable Objects

## Observer Pattern

### Key Components

- Subject
- Observer
- Concrete Subject
- Concrete Observer

### Workflow

- Registration
- Notification
- Update

### Pros

- Loose Coupling
- Scalability
- Flexibility & Extensibility
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Dynamic Relationships

### Cons

- Performance Issues
- Memory Leaks
- Ordering Dependencies
- Unintended Cascading Updates
- Security Concerns
- Tight Coupling (Subject and Observer must know each other)
- Debugging Difficulty

### Alternatives

- **Event Aggregator Pattern**
- Reactive Extensions (Rx)
- **Mediator Pattern**
- Callback/Delegate Approach
- **Message Queue Pattern**
- State Pattern
- Command Pattern

## Factory Pattern

### Key Components

- Factory to create objects
- Factory Interface / Abstract Class
- Concrete Factories
- Product Interface / Abstract Class
- Client
- Product Factories

### Pros

- Abstraction & Encapsulation
- Flexibility & Extensibility
- Centralized Control
- Code Maintenance
- Code Readability
- Dependency Inversion
- Separation of Concerns
- Consistency

### Cons

- Overhead
- Excessive Abstraction
- Tight Coupling
- Factory Proliferation
- Complex Hierarchies
- Runtime Configuration Overhead
- Open/Closed Principle Violation
- Learning Curve

### Alternatives

- **Direct Instantiation**
- Builder Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Static Factory Method**
- Service Locator Pattern
- Dependency Injection
- Strategy Pattern

## Importance of Context

- Suitability to the Problem
- Project Requirements
- Team Expertise
- Tech Stack
- System Evolution
- Performance Considerations
- Trade-Offs & Constraints
